TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
The version tool demonstrates:
  ✓ Windows cross-compilation works
  ✓ Trinity codebase compiles for Windows
  ✓ Build infrastructure is functional
  ✓ MinGW toolchain is configured correctly

Building the full wallet requires:
  - Qt 5.x GUI framework
  - Boost C++ libraries
  - BerkeleyDB database
  - OpenSSL cryptography
  - Cross-compiled for Windows

These dependencies total ~500 MB and take 2-4 hours to build
from source, which is why we provide the build kit instead of
a pre-built full wallet binary.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------
Version Tool:
  - Windows 7 or later (64-bit)
  - 4 MB RAM
  - No additional dependencies

Full GUI Wallet (when built):
  - Windows 7 or later (64-bit)
  - 2 GB RAM minimum
  - 500 MB disk space
